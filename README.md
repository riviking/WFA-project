there are 4 windows forms those are connected each other.
I have used a sql database file too.
i used features like buttons,labals,datagridviews,pictureboxes,checkboxes.
It's a real pleasure to say that datagridviews,pictureboxes,checkboxes were used by me for my very first time.
i've tried to use comboboxes, but it was being difficult to me as an Ametuar.
Then I gave up using ComboBoxes.
